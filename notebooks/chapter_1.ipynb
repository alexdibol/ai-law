You type a question or request, the system responds in natural language, and within seconds you have an answer, draft, or explanation. It feels like having a knowledgeable assistant available instantly at any time. For casual uses—planning a vacation, drafting a birthday card, explaining a concept to your child—this informal approach works perfectly fine.\n","\n","But legal practice operates under fundamentally different rules than casual conversation. When you use artificial intelligence as a lawyer, you're not just getting helpful suggestions for personal use. You're potentially creating work product that affects client rights, court proceedings, and professional liability. You're handling confidential information protected by attorney-client privilege. You're subject to ethics rules that require competence, supervision, and documentation. The stakes are dramatically higher, and the informal approach that works for casual use becomes professionally dangerous.\n","\n","This notebook teaches you how to use artificial intelligence chatbots for legal drafting and client communication in a way that meets professional responsibility standards. It's not about avoiding these tools—they offer genuine efficiency gains for routine tasks. It's about using them appropriately, with proper controls, documentation, and human oversight. Think of it as the difference between having a casual conversation with a friend about legal issues versus providing formal legal advice to a client. The underlying communication might be similar, but the professional context requires completely different standards.\n","\n","**What Makes Legal AI Usage Different**\n","\n","When you use a consumer chatbot app, several things happen invisibly that create problems for lawyers. First, you typically paste your question or information directly into the interface without thinking about confidentiality. The service provider sees your input, stores it on their servers, and may use it to train future models. For vacation planning, this doesn't matter. For client information protected by attorney-client privilege, this is potentially a waiver of that privilege.\n","\n","Second, consumer chatbots give you an answer with no audit trail. You see the response, maybe copy it somewhere, and move on. There's no record of what you asked, what parameters controlled the response, or what version of the model you used. For personal use, this is fine. For professional work that might be questioned months later by a client, opposing counsel, or a court, this lack of documentation is indefensible.\n","\n","Third, consumer chatbots provide no systematic way to identify risks in their outputs. Artificial intelligence models can hallucinate facts, invent legal citations, or produce plausible-sounding but incorrect information. In casual use, you might catch obvious errors or they don't matter much. In legal work, an invented case citation in a court filing can result in sanctions, and incorrect factual statements in client communications can create malpractice liability.\n","\n","Fourth, consumer interfaces encourage treating artificial intelligence as an authority rather than a tool. The conversational format makes outputs feel like expert advice. But these systems don't \"know\" things the way humans do—they predict probable text patterns based on training data. They can be confidently wrong. Lawyers need to maintain appropriate professional distance and skepticism, which the casual chat interface doesn't encourage.\n","\n","**What This Notebook Does Differently**\n","\n","This notebook implements what we call Level One governance controls—the minimum standards for safe legal use of chatbot artificial intelligence. Every interaction with the model happens through a wrapper that implements multiple safeguards. Before sending any text to the model, the system runs it through redaction to remove personally identifiable information. This reduces but doesn't eliminate confidentiality risks—it's a harm-reduction approach acknowledging that perfect protection isn't possible with external services.\n","\n","Every interaction gets logged with timestamps, cryptographic fingerprints, and redacted content previews. These logs create an audit trail showing what you asked, what the model returned, and what risks were identified. If you ever need to explain your artificial intelligence usage—to a client questioning a bill, to opposing counsel in discovery, to a disciplinary board investigating a complaint—you have comprehensive documentation showing you used the technology responsibly.\n","\n","The system enforces structured output from the model. Rather than accepting free-form text that might omit critical information, every response must include specific fields: what facts were provided, what assumptions the model made, what questions remain unanswered, what risks were identified, what verification is needed, and the actual draft output. This structure forces both the model and you as the user to think systematically about completeness and limitations.\n","\n","Automatic risk detection scans every output for warning signs. If the model produces something that looks like a legal citation—a case name, a statute number—the system flags potential hallucination, since the model wasn't asked to conduct legal research and may be inventing authorities. If the model identifies no open questions despite receiving limited facts, the system flags potential overconfidence. These automated checks catch common failure modes without requiring you to manually inspect every detail.\n","\n","The notebook generates governance artifacts for every session: a manifest documenting what system and parameters you used, a complete log of all prompts and responses, a risk register tracking all identified concerns, and human-readable deliverables for each task. At the end, everything packages into a zip file you can download and retain with your file, satisfying documentation requirements for quality control and file retention.\n","\n","**Why Chapter One Matters**\n","\n","This is Chapter One of a progression through increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence uses in legal practice. We start here—with simple drafting based on provided facts—because this represents the lowest-risk, highest-value use case for most lawyers today. You're not asking the artificial intelligence to conduct legal research, analyze complex legal issues, or make strategic judgments. You're asking it to help draft routine communications based on facts you provide. The model serves as a writing assistant, not a legal analyst.\n","\n","But even this simple use case requires the governance framework you'll learn here. Every control implemented in this notebook—redaction, structured output, logging, risk detection, human review—addresses a real professional responsibility risk that has caused actual problems for lawyers using artificial intelligence without proper safeguards. Bar associations have issued sanctions for invented citations, malpractice claims have been filed over incorrect artificial intelligence-generated advice, and privilege waivers have occurred through careless data handling.\n","\n","The habits you develop in Chapter One—minimizing sensitive inputs, maintaining logs, flagging risks, requiring human review—scale up to more advanced uses. When you move to Chapter Two covering legal research assistance, or Chapter Three covering more autonomous workflows, you'll build on this foundation rather than starting from scratch. The governance mindset matters more than any specific technical control, and this chapter establishes that mindset through hands-on practice.\n","\n","You'll work through four realistic scenarios spanning different practice areas: a criminal bail letter, a regulatory comment outline, an international contract email to a client, and an academic policy on student artificial intelligence use. Each scenario demonstrates both the capability and the limitations of current artificial intelligence tools. You'll see what works well—routine drafting from clear facts—and what doesn't—inventing legal authorities or making judgment calls. This calibration of appropriate expectations is itself a professional competence requirement.\n","\n","By the end of this notebook, you'll have created a complete audit trail for a governed artificial intelligence session. More importantly, you'll understand why each control exists, what risks it addresses, and how to adapt the approach to your specific practice needs. This isn't paint-by-numbers compliance—it's building genuine professional competence with an increasingly important tool category.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"dFfmE3Qv1Nnq"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"VGkhci-Ai_RA"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##2.LIBRARIES AND ENVIRONMENT"],"metadata":{"id":"n_1pIwN2i_rW"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 2: Install + Imports\n","\n","print(\"Installing dependencies...\")\n","!pip install -q anthropic\n","\n","print(\"\\nImporting libraries...\")\n","import json\n","import os\n","import re\n","import hashlib\n","import platform\n","from datetime import datetime\n","from pathlib import Path\n","from textwrap import dedent\n","import subprocess\n","\n","# Create base run directory with timestamp\n","timestamp = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\")\n","RUN_DIR = Path(f\"/content/ai_law_ch1_runs/run_{timestamp}\")\n","RUN_DIR.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n","\n","# Create subdirectories\n","DELIVERABLES_DIR = RUN_DIR / \"deliverables\"\n","DELIVERABLES_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n","\n","print(f\"\\n✅ Run directory created: {RUN_DIR}\")\n","print(f\"✅ Deliverables directory: {DELIVERABLES_DIR}\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"65nIIDIljB7s","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767791664368,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":7376,"user":{"displayName":"Alejandro Reynoso del Valle","userId":"04174712603211483042"}},"outputId":"04944ea7-baeb-472d-fa6e-46c2600cf2e6"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Installing dependencies...\n","\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m388.2/388.2 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m8.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h\n","Importing libraries...\n","\n","✅ Run directory created: /content/ai_law_ch1_runs/run_20260107_131424\n","✅ Deliverables directory: /content/ai_law_ch1_runs/run_20260107_131424/deliverables\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##3.ANTRHOPIC INITIALIZATION"],"metadata":{"id":"GohVEKR3jCkQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###3.1.OVERVIEW"],"metadata":{"id":"Vdgg6IS6mLfj"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Section 3: API Key and Anthropic Client Initialization**\n","\n","This section connects your notebook to Claude by setting up authentication. Think of it like logging into a secure service—you need valid credentials before you can use the AI model.\n","\n","The section uses Google Colab's built-in secrets manager to store your API key safely. Instead of typing your key directly into the code where others might see it, you add it through Colab's interface by clicking the key icon in the sidebar. This approach protects your credentials from accidental exposure when sharing notebooks.\n","\n","When the code runs, it attempts to retrieve your API key from the secrets storage. If successful, you see a confirmation message. If the key is missing, the notebook doesn't just crash—it provides clear step-by-step instructions showing exactly how to add the secret. This user-friendly error handling is especially important for lawyers who may be less familiar with programming environments.\n","\n","Once authenticated, the code initializes the Anthropic client object, which acts as your connection to Claude throughout the notebook. The code also specifies exactly which version of Claude to use by setting the model string. This precision matters for professional responsibility because different model versions can produce different outputs. By locking in a specific version, you ensure reproducibility—running the notebook again later will use the same AI model, not whatever newest version exists.\n","\n","The confirmation messages that appear after successful setup serve multiple purposes. First, they provide immediate feedback that everything worked correctly. Second, they display the exact model version being used, which becomes part of your documentation trail. If you ever need to explain to a client, court, or ethics board which AI system you used, this information provides that answer.\n","\n","From a governance perspective, this section establishes the foundation of your audit trail. The model version recorded here will be written to your run manifest in the next section. This creates a clear record of exactly which AI system generated your outputs.\n","\n","The separation between authentication in this section and logging in later sections follows good design principles. Each cell has one clear responsibility. If your organization uses different API key management in the future, you can modify just this section without affecting the rest of the notebook's functionality.\n","\n","This setup also acknowledges that AI services are external tools requiring credentials, not magic boxes that just work. By making authentication explicit and visible, the notebook reinforces that you're using a commercial service with clear boundaries and controls. This transparency is important for maintaining appropriate professional distance from the technology—you're using a tool, not delegating professional judgment."],"metadata":{"id":"yntRgLJtxppK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###3.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"kpomjU6KmNMM"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 3: API Key + Anthropic Client Initialization\n","\n","import anthropic\n","\n","# Get API key from Colab userdata (secrets)\n","from google.colab import userdata\n","\n","try:\n","    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = userdata.get('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')\n","    os.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\n","    api_key_loaded = True\n","    print(\"✅ API key loaded: yes\")\n","except Exception as e:\n","    api_key_loaded = False\n","    print(\"❌ API key loaded: no\")\n","    print(\"\\n⚠️ ERROR: Anthropic API key not found!\")\n","    print(\"\\nTo fix this:\")\n","    print(\"1.

One function generates timestamps in a standard format that works across different time zones and computer systems. Another writes data to files in a structured format that both humans and computers can read. A third creates cryptographic fingerprints of text, allowing you to verify later that logged content hasn't been altered without storing full copies of potentially confidential information.\n","\n","The environment fingerprint function captures technical details about your computing setup—Python version, operating system, installed software packages. This might seem excessive, but it serves a critical purpose: reproducibility. If you need to recreate these exact results months later, perhaps because a client questions an output or opposing counsel challenges your methods, you need to know exactly what software environment produced the original results. Different software versions can produce subtly different outputs, so documenting your environment is like noting which edition of a legal treatise you cited.\n","\n","The run manifest acts as the master record for this session. It captures who authored the notebook, which AI model was used, what parameters controlled the model's behavior, when everything ran, and what the notebook's purpose was.

The disclaimer embedded in the manifest establishes upfront that all outputs are drafts requiring human lawyer review, not final work product.\n","\n","Three separate artifact files work together as your audit system.

When you transmit data to an AI provider, you may waive attorney-client privilege and work-product protection. This section provides technical controls to reduce that risk, though it cannot eliminate it entirely.\n","\n","The redaction function automatically scans text for common types of sensitive information and masks them before sending anything to the AI. It looks for patterns like email addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, street addresses, and names with titles. When it finds these patterns, it replaces them with placeholder text and creates a list of what was removed. This gives you transparency into the sanitization process.\n","\n","The function acknowledges its limitations openly. The pattern-matching approach is imperfect by design. For example, the name detection only catches names with titles like Mister or Doctor, so it will miss many real names. The address detection only recognizes common street suffixes, so unusual or international addresses may slip through. These limitations are inherent to automated pattern-matching, which is why the code includes prominent warnings that human review remains essential.\n","\n","The minimal input builder applies an important principle: only send AI systems the information they absolutely need for the specific task.

It wraps every call to Claude with multiple layers of control: input sanitization, structured output enforcement, retry logic, automatic risk detection, and comprehensive logging. This transforms a simple API call into a professionally defensible process.\n","\n","The JSON extraction function solves a practical problem: artificial intelligence models don't always follow instructions perfectly. Even when explicitly told to return only structured data with no extra text, Claude sometimes adds explanatory preambles or wraps output in formatting marks. This function implements four different strategies to find valid structured data within messy responses. It tries parsing the whole response first, then looks for content between brackets, handles formatting blocks, and finally uses sophisticated bracket-balancing to extract complete data structures. This belt-and-suspenders approach ensures robustness in real-world usage.\n","\n","The main wrapper function builds an extremely explicit instruction set for Claude. Rather than assuming the model will understand \"return structured data,\" it repeats the instruction multiple times in different ways, shows the exact structure to copy, lists what not to do, and provides a final reminder. This repetitive approach compensates for the fact that language models sometimes miss instructions buried in long prompts.\n","\n","The retry logic implements three attempts with progressively stricter instructions and lower creativity settings. First attempt uses standard instructions with minimal creativity. If that fails, the second attempt adds even more explicit constraints and eliminates creativity entirely. Third attempt repeats this approach. If all three fail, the system returns a valid error structure rather than crashing, ensuring the notebook continues running even when individual tasks encounter problems.\n","\n","Automatic risk detection analyzes outputs for warning signs. If the response contains no questions about missing information, the system flags potential incompleteness. If the draft contains patterns that look like legal citations—case names, statute numbers, court references—the system flags potential hallucination, since the model might be inventing authorities that don't exist. These automated checks catch common failure modes without requiring manual inspection of every output.\n","\n","Comprehensive logging records every interaction. Each API call generates a log entry with timestamps, task identifiers, cryptographic fingerprints of inputs and outputs, and success indicators. The prompts log uses a streaming format that allows incremental writes, so even if the notebook crashes, you have records of everything that happened before the crash. The risk log accumulates all flagged concerns across all tasks, creating a master list of issues requiring human review.\n","\n","From a professional responsibility standpoint, this section implements appropriate supervision of AI tools. You're not blindly accepting whatever the model produces—you're validating structure, detecting risks, maintaining records, and building in redundancy. If questioned about your AI usage, you can demonstrate that you implemented multiple safeguards rather than treating the technology as infallible."],"metadata":{"id":"8KihAsxJy6N0"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###6.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"1OPeYs_yn0nu"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 6: LLM Call Wrapper with ROBUST JSON Extraction + Risk Flags\n","\n","def extract_json_from_text(text):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Robustly extract JSON from text that may contain extra content.\n","    Tries multiple strategies to find and extract valid JSON.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # Strategy 1: Try the whole text as-is\n","    try:\n","        return json.loads(text.strip())\n","    except json.JSONDecodeError:\n","        pass\n","\n","    # Strategy 2: Look for JSON between curly braces (most common pattern)\n","    # Find the first { and last }\n","    first_brace = text.find('{')\n","    last_brace = text.rfind('}')\n","\n","    if first_brace != -1 and last_brace != -1 and last_brace > first_brace:\n","        try:\n","            json_str = text[first_brace:last_brace + 1]\n","            return json.loads(json_str)\n","        except json.JSONDecodeError:\n","            pass\n","\n","    # Strategy 3: Remove markdown code blocks\n","    # Pattern: ```json ... ``` or ``` ... ```\n","    import re\n","    code_block_pattern = r'```(?:json)?\\s*(\\{.*?\\})\\s*```'\n","    matches = re.findall(code_block_pattern, text, re.DOTALL)\n","    if matches:\n","        for match in matches:\n","            try:\n","                return json.loads(match)\n","            except json.JSONDecodeError:\n","                continue\n","\n","    # Strategy 4: Try to find largest JSON-like structure\n","    # Look for balanced braces\n","    stack = []\n","    start_idx = -1\n","\n","    for i, char in enumerate(text):\n","        if char == '{':\n","            if not stack:\n","                start_idx = i\n","            stack.append(char)\n","        elif char == '}':\n","            if stack:\n","                stack.pop()\n","                if not stack and start_idx != -1:\n","                    # Found a complete JSON object\n","                    try:\n","                        return json.loads(text[start_idx:i+1])\n","                    except json.JSONDecodeError:\n","                        continue\n","\n","    # All strategies failed\n","    return None\n","\n","\n","def call_claude(task_name, user_prompt, facts):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Call Claude with governance controls and ROBUST JSON handling.\n","\n","    This version is designed to handle Claude's tendency to add explanatory\n","    text around JSON responses.\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    # Build system prompt with VERY explicit JSON-only instruction\n","    system_prompt = dedent(\"\"\"\n","    You are a legal drafting assistant.

Each scenario represents a different practice area and communication type, showing the breadth of potential applications while maintaining consistent safety standards.\n","\n","The criminal bail case provides concrete facts about a defendant charged with a non-violent offense. Rather than vague details, it specifies employment history, family ties, and residence information—the kinds of facts that actually matter in bail decisions. The prompt asks for a brief letter with clear word limits and specific content requirements. This bounded approach prevents the model from wandering into speculation or producing excessive output.\n","\n","The regulatory comment case involves a bank responding to proposed federal rules. Again, the facts are specific: bank size, regulation details, implementation timeline, and estimated costs. The prompt requests an outline rather than a complete letter, acknowledging that complex regulatory work requires significant human expertise beyond what artificial intelligence can provide. The structure guides the model toward practical concerns—implementation challenges, costs, timeline requests—rather than legal analysis.\n","\n","The international contract case addresses cross-border commercial transactions. The facts establish context: which countries, what type of business, what the vendor proposed. The prompt asks for a client-friendly email explaining complex concepts in plain language. This scenario recognizes that lawyers often serve as translators between legal technicalities and business realities. The model helps with clear explanation, not legal advice about which option to choose.\n","\n","The teaching policy case demonstrates that governance frameworks apply beyond client work. Law professors need clear policies about student use of artificial intelligence tools. The facts specify the course, institution, and instructor preferences. The prompt requests rules plus rationale—not just telling students what to do, but explaining why certain restrictions matter pedagogically.\n","\n","Each case follows the same structural pattern: concrete facts with specific details, clear task description with word limits, content requirements in bullet format, tone guidance, and a reminder to include the required disclaimer. This consistency makes the cases predictable for the model while allowing variation in substance.\n","\n","The prompts deliberately avoid open-ended meta-questions like \"identify what information you need.\" Such questions invite prose explanations rather than structured output. Instead, the structured data format includes a field for open questions, allowing the model to flag missing information naturally within the required schema.\n","\n","From a pedagogical perspective, these four scenarios show lawyers that governance doesn't mean avoiding artificial intelligence—it means using it appropriately. Simple drafting tasks based on provided facts fall within current capabilities. Complex analysis, legal research requiring citations, or judgment calls about strategy remain human responsibilities. By demonstrating both appropriate and bounded use cases, the notebook teaches sound professional judgment about when and how to employ these tools."],"metadata":{"id":"t_uWKjTSzTsg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###7.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"A6DLH47PoHTo"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 7: Mini-Case Builders (4 recurring scenarios) - SIMPLIFIED\n","\n","def case_criminal_bail():\n","    \"\"\"Criminal: Bail letter / mitigation narrative draft\"\"\"\n","    return {\n","        \"task_name\": \"criminal_bail_letter\",\n","        \"facts\": [\n","            \"Defendant: John Doe (name redacted for exercise)\",\n","            \"Charge: Non-violent property offense (theft under $500)\",\n","            \"Criminal history: None\",\n","            \"Employment: Full-time warehouse worker for 3 years at ABC Company\",\n","            \"Residence: Lives with spouse and two children in the county\",\n","            \"Family ties: Elderly mother lives nearby, defendant provides care\"\n","        ],\n","        \"prompt\": \"\"\"Task: Draft a brief bail letter to the court (250 words maximum).\n","\n","Content to include:\n","- Request for release pending trial\n","- Emphasize community ties (employment, family)\n","- Note lack of flight risk\n","- Professional, respectful tone\n","\n","Output format: A concise letter suitable for court filing.\n","\n","Include the required disclaimer at the end.\"\"\"\n","    }\n","\n","def case_regulatory_comment():\n","    \"\"\"Regulatory/Administrative: Draft comment letter outline to agency\"\"\"\n","    return {\n","        \"task_name\": \"regulatory_comment_letter\",\n","        \"facts\": [\n","            \"Client: First Community Bank (regional bank, $2B in assets)\",\n","            \"Regulation: Proposed real-time transaction reporting rule\",\n","            \"Agency: Federal Financial Regulatory Agency\",\n","            \"Timeline: 60-day comment period, 18-month implementation proposed\",\n","            \"Client concern: Current systems cannot support real-time reporting\",\n","            \"Estimated compliance cost: $5-8 million in system upgrades\"\n","        ],\n","        \"prompt\": \"\"\"Task: Draft an outline for a regulatory comment letter (bullet points acceptable).\n","\n","Structure the outline with these sections:\n","1.

Rather than assuming everything will work perfectly, it's designed to continue functioning even when individual cases encounter problems, creating a realistic model for professional practice where not everything always goes smoothly.\n","\n","The execution loop processes each case individually within error-catching blocks. If one case fails, the notebook doesn't crash—it logs the error, creates an error deliverable for that case, and moves on to the next one. This resilience matters because you might run this notebook dozens of times while developing prompts or testing different fact patterns. Having the entire process halt because of one problematic case would make iteration frustrating and slow.\n","\n","Progress indicators appear throughout execution. You see which case is being processed, whether the model call succeeded, and which files were saved. These status messages serve both technical and psychological purposes. Technically, they help diagnose problems when things go wrong. Psychologically, they provide reassurance that the notebook is working rather than frozen, especially important during the API calls which can take several seconds each.\n","\n","Each successful case generates two deliverable files. The structured data file captures everything in machine-readable format—facts, assumptions, questions, risks, draft output, verification status. The human-readable text file presents the same information formatted for easy review, with clear section headers and the required disclaimer prominently displayed at the top. This dual format acknowledges that both humans and automated systems may need to process these outputs.\n","\n","Even failed cases generate deliverables. The error structure includes the error message, empty lists for standard fields, and a high-severity risk noting the system failure. This ensures that your deliverables folder contains a file for every case attempted, making it easy to identify which cases succeeded and which need attention.\n","\n","The statistics tracking counts successful versus failed cases throughout execution. At the end, a summary table displays case names, number of open questions identified, highest risk severity, and completion status using visual indicators. This table provides an at-a-glance assessment of the entire run—did everything work, or do certain cases need investigation?\n","\n","The minimum standard document created here serves as educational material. It enumerates the five core controls that lawyers should implement when using artificial intelligence for drafting: minimize sensitive inputs, stick to facts-only tasks, verify all claims, maintain logs for material use, and require lawyer review before client-facing use. This document can be shared with colleagues, included in training materials, or referenced in firm policies.\n","\n","From a governance perspective, this section demonstrates appropriate quality control.

Rather than assuming everything will work perfectly, it's designed to continue functioning even when individual cases encounter problems, creating a realistic model for professional practice where not everything always goes smoothly.\n","\n","The execution loop processes each case individually within error-catching blocks. If one case fails, the notebook doesn't crash—it logs the error, creates an error deliverable for that case, and moves on to the next one. This resilience matters because you might run this notebook dozens of times while developing prompts or testing different fact patterns. Having the entire process halt because of one problematic case would make iteration frustrating and slow.\n","\n","Progress indicators appear throughout execution. You see which case is being processed, whether the model call succeeded, and which files were saved. These status messages serve both technical and psychological purposes. Technically, they help diagnose problems when things go wrong. Psychologically, they provide reassurance that the notebook is working rather than frozen, especially important during the API calls which can take several seconds each.\n","\n","Each successful case generates two deliverable files. The structured data file captures everything in machine-readable format—facts, assumptions, questions, risks, draft output, verification status. The human-readable text file presents the same information formatted for easy review, with clear section headers and the required disclaimer prominently displayed at the top. This dual format acknowledges that both humans and automated systems may need to process these outputs.\n","\n","Even failed cases generate deliverables. The error structure includes the error message, empty lists for standard fields, and a high-severity risk noting the system failure. This ensures that your deliverables folder contains a file for every case attempted, making it easy to identify which cases succeeded and which need attention.\n","\n","The statistics tracking counts successful versus failed cases throughout execution. At the end, a summary table displays case names, number of open questions identified, highest risk severity, and completion status using visual indicators. This table provides an at-a-glance assessment of the entire run—did everything work, or do certain cases need investigation?\n","\n","The minimum standard document created here serves as educational material. It enumerates the five core controls that lawyers should implement when using artificial intelligence for drafting: minimize sensitive inputs, stick to facts-only tasks, verify all claims, maintain logs for material use, and require lawyer review before client-facing use. This document can be shared with colleagues, included in training materials, or referenced in firm policies.\n","\n","From a governance perspective, this section demonstrates appropriate quality control. You're not blindly accepting model outputs—you're tracking what succeeded, what failed, what risks were identified, and creating documentation for human review.

Rather than scattering files across multiple locations or expecting users to manually collect outputs, it creates a complete audit bundle that meets professional responsibility standards for record-keeping.\n","\n","The audit readme serves as the guidebook for the entire bundle. It explains what each file contains, why it exists, and how to interpret it. This documentation matters because six months from now, you or a colleague might need to understand what happened in this session. The readme provides that context without requiring you to remember technical details or reconstruct the process from memory.\n","\n","The readme explains how to review the prompts log safely. Since the log contains redacted versions of inputs and outputs plus cryptographic fingerprints, reviewers can verify what happened without exposing full potentially-confidential content. The fingerprints allow integrity verification—you can prove the logged content hasn't been altered—while the redacted previews provide enough context to understand what each interaction involved.\n","\n","Reproducibility instructions tell readers exactly what software environment, model version, parameters, and process were used. If you need to recreate these results, perhaps because a client questions an output or you want to validate the approach with different facts, these instructions provide the roadmap. The readme acknowledges that exact reproduction may not be possible due to model updates or non-deterministic behavior, but documents everything that can be controlled.\n","\n","Professional responsibility notes explain why this documentation matters for legal ethics. The bundle serves as evidence of competence in tool use, reasonable supervision of artificial intelligence-assisted work, and compliance with file retention requirements. It demonstrates quality control processes rather than blind reliance on technology. These explanations help lawyers understand that governance isn't bureaucratic overhead—it's how you demonstrate professional responsibility when using new tools.\n","\n","The file inventory lists every artifact created, showing file paths and sizes. This manifest ensures nothing gets lost and provides a quick overview of bundle contents. The summary statistics—total files, total size—give a sense of the documentation scope.\n","\n","The contents checklist verifies that all required artifacts are present: manifest with environment details, complete prompt log, risk tracking log, all mini-case deliverables, minimum standard document, environment snapshot, and the readme itself. Visual indicators show at a glance whether the bundle is complete or missing components.\n","\n","Download instructions provide multiple methods for retrieving the zip file, recognizing that users have different comfort levels with technical interfaces. Some prefer clicking through the file browser, others prefer running code commands. Offering both options makes the tool accessible to lawyers with varying technical backgrounds.\n","\n","From a governance perspective, this final section completes the audit trail loop. You started by documenting what you intended to do, logged what actually happened, and now package everything for retention and future reference. This closed loop provides defensibility if your artificial intelligence usage is ever questioned or audited."],"metadata":{"id":"aWilBZjB0j6F"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###10.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"PuWNFot6uTXp"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 10: Bundle Artifacts + Audit Readme + Zip\n","\n","print(\"=\" * 60)\n","print(\"CREATING AUDIT BUNDLE\")\n","print(\"=\" * 60)\n","\n","# Create audit README\n","audit_readme = dedent(f\"\"\"\n","============================================================\n","AUDIT README - AI FOR LAWYERS CHAPTER 1\n","============================================================\n","\n","Run ID: {manifest['run_id']}\n","Generated: {now_iso()}\n","Author: Alejandro Reynoso\n","Model: {MODEL}\n","\n","This bundle contains a complete audit trail of an AI-assisted\n","legal drafting session using Level 1 governance controls.\n","\n","============================================================\n","CONTENTS OF THIS BUNDLE\n","============================================================\n","\n","1. run_manifest.json\n","   - Unique run identifier\n","   - Timestamp and environment details\n","   - Model and parameters used\n","   - Python dependencies (pip_freeze.txt)\n","\n","2. prompts_log.jsonl\n","   - Every prompt sent to the AI model\n","   - Every response received\n","   - All content is redacted for confidentiality\n","   - Includes SHA-256 hashes for integrity verification\n","   - JSONL format (one JSON object per line)\n","\n","3. risk_log.json\n","   - All identified risks across all tasks\n","   - Risk types: confidentiality, privilege, hallucination,\n","     missing_facts, unauthorized_practice, tone, other\n","   - Severity levels: low, medium, high\n","   - Timestamped entries for each risk\n","\n","4. deliverables/ folder\n","   - Output files for each demo mini-case\n","   - JSON format (machine-readable)\n","   - TXT format (human-readable)\n","   - User exercise outputs\n","   - Minimum standard document\n","\n","5. pip_freeze.txt\n","   - Complete list of Python packages and versions\n","   - Enables reproducibility of the environment\n","\n","6.
