# Practical Legal Applications of Generative AI (AI LAW)

## What this repository contains
This repository supports the book **Practical Legal Applications of Generative AI (AI LAW)**, an educational, governance-first guide for **U.S. legal practice**. It is designed to help practicing lawyers build a clear mental model of what generative AI can do today, where it fails, and how to use it safely under professional responsibility constraints.

## Who this is for
- U.S.-based practicing lawyers and legal professionals  
- Readers with minimal AI background who want practical workflows, not hype  
- Teams building policies, templates, and controlled processes for AI-assisted legal work  

## The book’s core idea: a five-level maturity ladder
This book treats generative AI **not as legal authority**, but as a tool whose usefulness depends on **disciplined workflows, verification, and accountability**. It presents a five-level maturity ladder that progresses from individual assistance to organization-grade operations:

- **Level 1 — Chatbots:** supervised drafting and client communication support  
- **Level 2 — Reasoners:** structured issue spotting, IRAC-style analysis, argument mapping  
- **Level 3 — Agents:** multi-step workflows under human approval gates (human-in-the-loop)  
- **Level 4 — Innovators:** reusable assets such as playbooks, clause libraries, checklists, and adversarial tests  
- **Level 5 — Organizations:** an end-to-end operating model where a team can routinely explain what was produced and how—redacted inputs, prompts/roles, risks flagged, verification tasks, and sign-off responsibility  

## What makes this governance-first (and why that matters in law)
The focus is **professional defensibility**. Each chapter emphasizes controls that make AI outputs safer to review and harder to misuse:

- Strict separation of **generation vs. verification**  
- Explicit labeling of **facts provided vs. assumptions vs. open questions**  
- Zero-tolerance posture toward **invented authority** (no fabricated citations, cases, statutes, or rules)  
- Governance-native artifacts that make work **replayable and auditable**: run manifests, prompt logs, risk logs, verification checklists, deliverables bundles, and sign-off records  

## Recurring mini-cases used across all chapters
To keep learning concrete, every level is demonstrated using the same four mini-cases:

- **Criminal**  
- **Regulatory / Administrative**  
- **International**  
- **Teaching / Academia**  

Each chapter ends with a **minimum standard checklist** that can be adopted immediately in real practice settings.

## Important note (read carefully)
This repository and book are **educational materials**. They are **not legal advice**. Human lawyer review is required for any reliance-bearing use. Confidentiality, privilege, competence, supervision, candor, and client communication obligations apply at every step.

Do **not** paste sensitive client information into external model prompts; use redaction and “minimum necessary” inputs by default.
